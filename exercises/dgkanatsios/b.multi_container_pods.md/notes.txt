# Multi-container pods and connecting to second container

...
spec:
  containers:
  - name: busybox
    image: busybox
    command: ['/bin/sh', '-c']
    args: ['echo Hello, World!']
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80
  - name: busybox2 # Note this name MUST BE different from the first container
    image: busybox
    command: ['/bin/sh', '-c']
    args: ['echo Hello, World!']


To connect to the second container, use the following command:

k exec -it <pod-name> -c <second-container-name> -- <command>

e.g.

k exec -it busybox -c busybox2 -- 'ls'

# Init-containers

They executed first before the main containers in the pod. They are used to prepare the environment for the main containers.
They cannot do probes though (liveness, readiness, startup). If need this then do sidecar container instead.
