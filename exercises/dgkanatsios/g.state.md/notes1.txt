- For emptyDir volumes without any definition, you can define it as following:

...
spec:
    volumes:
    - name: <vol-name>
      emptyDir: {} # use curly braces (i.e. {}) to define an emptyDir volume

- To connect to second container in a pod, use the following command:
k exec -it <pod-name> -c <second-container-name> -- <command>

e.g.

k exec -it busybox -c busybox2 -- /bin/sh

- To check mounting on a pod, use the following command:

mount | grep <subpath of the volume>

e.g.

/ # mount | grep foo
/dev/vda1 on /etc/foo type ext4 (rw,relatime)

- It is possible to have multiple accessModes in a PVC.

e.g.

...
spec:
    accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
    - ReadOnlyMany
    - ReadWriteMany
    ...

- If there are multiple pods connecting to the same PVC, the PVC will be mounted to the pods, provided they are hosted in the same node.

- Copying files from a pod to local machine:

k copy <pod-name>:<path-to-file> <local-path>

e.g.

k copy busybox:/etc/passwd ./passwd
